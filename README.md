## üì¶ Installation

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm install @nestcorelib/core-lib

Or using yarn:

yarn add install @nestcorelib/core-lib
```

## üöÄ Basic Usage
To get started, simply import the module you need into your AppModule or feature module.

```ts
import { AuthModule } from '@nestcorelib/core-lib';

@Module({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.register({
      jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      expiresIn: '1h',
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
### üß© User Management (Service Layer)

NestCoreLib provides a ready-to-use AuthService with full user management functionality out of the box. Simply extend it, and you‚Äôre good to go ‚Äî no boilerplate required. You can also override or extend any method to add custom logic.

```ts
import { AuthService } from '@nestcorelib/core-lib';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { User } from './entities/user.entities'; // Works with both Prisma and TypeORM models

@Injectable()
export class TestService extends AuthService<User, Dto> {}

```

### User Management (Controller Layer)

NestCoreLib also offers a prebuilt AuthController that exposes all necessary routes for user authentication and management. You can extend it directly to start using it immediately, and optionally override methods or decorators to apply custom DTOs, pipes, guards, etc.

```ts
import { User as userEntity } from './entities/user.entities';
import { AuthController } from '@nestcorelib/core-lib';

@Controller('test')
export class TestController extends AuthController {}
```

#### üí° Notes

* Both AuthService and AuthController are fully typed and generic ‚Äî giving you flexibility to integrate with your specific User entity and DTOs.
* Whether you're using Prisma or TypeORM, NestCoreLib supports both ORMs out of the box.
